## Prettier Update Released!

The <b>Prettier Update</b> has been launched, giving the site a new look!

#### What is in the update:

-   The website now has a color scheme!
-   There is a border around event cards, making it easier to see where event information starts and stops.
-   The event title is now placed at the top of the event card.
-   There is an actual save icon to click when saving an event.
-   There is now feedback when interacting with the different buttons on the page.
-   The Navigation panel takes up only what it needs to and not most of the page.

#### Bug Fixes:

-   Event card information will no longer be displaced by long titles.
-   The Search feature will not search for events if the current and last searched for term are the same.

#### Technical Changes:

-   Page styling has been changed from the Styled-Components library over to vanilla CSS.

## What's Next?

The next update will be the <b>Viewing Update</b>. The event cards will give you more information when clicked instead of sending you directly to the site.

#### Some information that will be available:

-   Location
-   Venue information
-   Parking information (free, paid, included, etc.)
-   About the event

## A Glimpse Into the Future

After the <b>Viewing Update</b>, there will be an update specifically for fixing bugs.

Once bugs have been squashed, the Saved events page will be getting some attention.

## Libraries Used

-   React
-   React-Router
